1.   Values are 'hello', -87.8, 6
     Expressions are -,/,+

2.   Variable:- Variables are used to store the data in a program, or we can say that it ia a empty box where we fill the data or value.
     String:-  String is the collection of the characters surrounded by single quotes, double quotes.

3.   Three different data types
     1. Numeric data type:
        int:- it holds integer values like 4,5,6
        float:- it hold dot(.) values like 4.5,34.54
        complex:- it holds complex values like 100+3j
     2. String data type: 
        str: it hold string values like 'jai', "soni"
     3. Sequence data type: 
        list: we can hold integer, string, float values in this using [] bracket
        tuple: we can hold integer, string, float values in this using () bracket
        dictionary: it is an unordered  sequence of key value pair form. It is very useful to retrive data in an optimized way among  large amount of data.

4.   Expression:- It is the combination of operands and operators that is interpreted to produce some other value.
     Expressions are ued to perform some certain operations like 10+20=30. Here 10 and 20 are operands and '+' is operator.

5.   Expressions can be assigned or used as operands, while statements can only be declared like spam=10

6.   bacon=22
     bacon +1 after run this code bacon will contain value 23.

7.   'spam' + 'spamspam'
     'spam' * 3  In both terms will get spamspamspam.

8.   As we all know, that variable names cannot begin with a number so, eggs is a valid variable and 100 is invalid.

9.   The three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point, or string version of a values are int(), float(), str().

10.  'I have eaten' +99+ 'burrritos.' The expression causes an error becuse 99 is an integer and only strings ca be concatenated 
     to other strings with the + operaotr. The correct way is i have eaten '+str(99)+' burrtios'.

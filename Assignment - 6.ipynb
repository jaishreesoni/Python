    "Q.2. What are the rules to create variables in python?\n",
    "\n",

    "           It can contain only alpha-numeric character and underscore(a-b,0-9 and _)\n",
    "           Variable names are case sensitive.\n",

    "        \n",
    "Q.3. What are the standards and conventions followed for the nomenclature of variables in python to improve code readability and maintainability?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:-\n",
    "Choose variable names that accurately describe the purpose or content of the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintain consistency in your naming conventions throughout your codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid single-letter variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have constants in your code, such as configuration values that should not be modified, use uppercase letters and underscores (UPPER_CASE) to distinguish them from variables.\n",

    "Avoid using reserved keywords as variable names to prevent conflicts and confusion.\n",

    "Q.4. What will happen if a keyword is used as a variable name?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:- Keywords define the language's syntax rules and structure, and they cannot be used as variable names.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Q.5. For what purpose def keyword is used?\n",

    "Here are some common escape sequences used with the backslash:\n",

    "'\\n': Newline. It represents a line break or a new line.\n",
